# Django State Keeper

Django State Keeper is a Django app that allows you to create backups of your project's database, media files, and
selected directories. It provides the ability to restore your project's state from a backup and offers automatic backups
sent to a Telegram chat.

## Features

- Create backups as ZIP files containing selected project files and directories.
- Restore project state by uploading a backup ZIP file.
- Configure automatic backups sent to a Telegram chat.

## Installation

1. Install the Django State Keeper library using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install django-state-keeper
   ```
